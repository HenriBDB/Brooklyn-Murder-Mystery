/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Brooklyn Murder" application.
 *  "Brooklyn Murder" is a very simple murder mystery game.  Users
 *  have to solve the case of the abduction of their friends and the
 *  murder of a witness. They do so by walking around a fictitious scenery
 *  based on the Brooklyn Nine-nine TV series, solving quests and gathering
 *  evidence. In the end they have to accuse the correct suspect to win.
 *
 *  To play this game, simply launch the JavaFX application.
 *  (On BlueJ right-click the GUI class and select Run JavaFX Application)
 *
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others except the GUI:
 *  it creates a player loads the game setup and starts the game.  It also
 *  evaluates and executes the commands that implement the game's mechanics.
